# URL Shortener

A simple and efficient URL shortening service that transforms long, cumbersome URLs into short, shareable links. This project is designed to be lightweight, easy to deploy, and customizable for various use cases, such as social media sharing, marketing campaigns, or personal link management.

## Features
- **URL Shortening**: Convert long URLs into concise, memorable links.
- **Redirection**: Seamlessly redirect users to the original URL using the shortened link.
- **Customizable Short Links** (optional, if implemented): Create custom aliases for shortened URLs.
- **Analytics** (optional, if implemented): Track click counts and other metrics for each shortened URL.
- **RESTful API**: Programmatically shorten and manage URLs.
- **Self-Hosted**: Host the service on your own server for full control.

## Tech Stack
*Note: Please verify the actual technologies used in the repository, as this is an assumed stack.*
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express (or Python with Flask, PHP with Laravel, etc.)
- **Database**: MongoDB (or Redis, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- **Frontend** (if applicable): HTML/CSS/JavaScript or a framework like React
- **Environment**: Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

## Prerequisites
- Git
- Node.js (or relevant runtime, e.g., Python, PHP) installed
- A database instance (e.g., MongoDB, Redis) if required
- Basic knowledge of command-line operations

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshalsonune55/URL_shortner.git
   cd URL_shortner
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   *For Node.js (adjust if using another language):*
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and configure the necessary variables, such as:
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
   DOMAIN=your_domain.com
   API_QUOTA=100
   URL_RETENTION_TIME=30d
   ```
   Refer to `.env.example` (if available) for required variables.

4. **Set Up the Database**:
   - If using MongoDB, ensure the MongoDB service is running and the connection string is correct.
   - If using another database, follow its setup instructions.

5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000` (or the configured port).

## Usage
1. **Via Web Interface** (if available):
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
   - Enter a long URL, click "Shorten," and receive a shortened link.
   - Use the shortened link to redirect to the original URL.

2. **Via API**:
   - **Shorten a URL**:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/shorten \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"url": "https://www.example.com"}'
     ```
     Response:
     ```json
     {
       "short_url": "http://localhost:3000/abc123",
       "long_url": "https://www.example.com"
     }
     ```

   - **Access a Shortened URL**:
     ```bash
     curl http://localhost:3000/abc123
     ```
     This redirects to the original URL.

3. **Custom Short URLs** (if supported):
   - Include a custom alias in the POST request:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/shorten \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"url": "https://www.example.com", "short": "custom123"}'
     ```
